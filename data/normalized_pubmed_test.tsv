gadoteridol|DRUG|Concurrent evaluation of CA4+ and entity partitions in cartilage is accomplished using QDECT .
gadoteridol|DRUG|Subsequent normalization of the CA4+ partition with that of the entity affords CA4+ attenuations that significantly correlate with PG content – a key marker of OA .
gadoteridol|DRUG|entity and gadoterate meglumine have a cyclic structure , making them less likely to release free Gd3+ , and there is only a single reported case of NSF associated with gadoteridol use alone .

fluoxetine|DRUG|In conclusion , we have studied the effects of entity on human early embryonic development .
fluoxetine|DRUG|We found that entity has marginal effects on the timing of developmental stages in embryos , but induces expression and secretion of several proteins in
fluoxetine|DRUG|Tranylcypromine and phenelzine are MAOIs , entity is an SSRI , and desipramine and amitriptyline are tricyclics .
fluoxetine|DRUG|this purpose , irradiated mice were tail vein injected with lymphoid cells from control and stressed animals treated or not with entity or sertraline .
fluoxetine|DRUG|In our study , the FPM generated highly accurate predictions for the group exposed to 10 µg entity / L ( Δ measured-predicted = 14% ) .
fluoxetine|DRUG|Results Prenatal entity treatment induced deficits in working memory and social recognition We subjected pregnant mice to daily intraperitoneal ( i . p . ) injections of 0 . 6 mg / kg

fluoxetine|DRUG|Haraguchi et al . [ 165 ] showed that same-day pretreatments with entity dose-dependently reduced ethanol responding .
fluoxetine|DRUG|UCMS exposure suppressed the consumption increase , an effect , which was reversed by entity treatment .
fluoxetine|DRUG|Interestingly , although irradiated mice did not display any behavioral alterations in control or UCMS conditions , they were insensitive to the entity reversal .
fluoxetine|DRUG|Randomised placebo-controlled trials have shown that venlafaxine , 16 entity , 17 and paroxetine 18 are effective in control of hot flashes .
fluoxetine|DRUG|of the present study was to identify the site of action mediating the previously observed facilitatory effect of peripherally administered entity on cocaine-induced motor behaviours in rats .

fluoxetine|DRUG|Uncontrolled studies have indeed suggested that some PSG effects of entity may persist for up to 19 months after discontinuation ,
fluoxetine|DRUG|occurrence of SJS / TEN after antidepressant drugs appeared in the 1990s and took into account all medications from the SSRI group : entity [ 16 ] and sertraline [ 17 ] .
fluoxetine|DRUG|Both drugs were administered via the drinking water , and mice consumed ~10 −5 M of theophylline or 12 to 16 mg / kg entity per 24 hours .
fluoxetine|DRUG|Thus , entity treatment in C6 cells facilitates the expression of NCAM140 but not that of either NCAM120 or NCAM180 , suggesting that entity may regulate synaptic plasticity via NCAM140 .
fluoxetine|DRUG|For example , entity has been noted to enhance the anticonvulsant effect of phenytoin and carbamazepine via selective inhibition of serotonin uptake [ 36

pilocarpine|DRUG|Scopolamine ( 2 mg / kg , i . p . , Sigma-Aldrich Co . , St . Louis , MO , USA ) was injected 30 min before the induction of seizures with entity .
pilocarpine|DRUG|Seizures are generally known to occur 20–30 min after injection of entity [ 44 ] .
